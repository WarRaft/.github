/i A stylized dark fantasy emblem of the Jolly Roger on a black background. A grim skull with glowing eyes, wearing a tattered pirate hat with a feather, and two crossed cutlasses behind it. The design is bold and minimalistic, with a slightly menacing expression and subtle magical elements like faint glowing runes or mist. Rendered in a fantasy style inspired by WarCraft â€” iconic, moody, and mysterious. Strong silhouette, high contrast, and a sense of cursed pirate legend.

/edit Place the pirate skull logo at the center of a dark fantasy emblem. Surround it with a sharp, stylized frame made of cracked wood, blades, or pirate ship debris, matching the aggressive and high-contrast aesthetic of the original image. The frame should form a clear, well-defined border (circle or shield shape) that looks natural in the composition and makes background removal easy.
