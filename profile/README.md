Welcome aboard the **WarRaft** — a totally unnecessary, semi-serious and fully heart-driven voyage to build tools for a
20-year-old game that never really left our hearts.

Flying the **Jolly Roger**, we sail through forgotten file formats and cursed codebases — not because anyone asked, but
because *we still care*. This isn't just about tech. It's about the smell of pine trees in Ashenvale, the clash of
Blademasters, and that one
custom map you could never finish.
