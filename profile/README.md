# [JASS Tree-sitter Rust](https://github.com/WarRaft/JASS-Tree-sitter-Rust)

We're currently working on a totally serious VSCode plugin that brings Tree-sitter-powered syntax support for the JASS
scripting language â€” written in Rust, of course, because why not overengineer a 20-year-old language?

This highly unnecessary yet oddly satisfying project is our small (and possibly misguided) attempt to make the world a
better place, one obscure scripting language at a time.
